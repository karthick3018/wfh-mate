# wfh-mate description: 
Since work from home is the current and upcoming methodology we're following and going to follow in the future. Managing time,taking a break,intake of water these are the some of things that i've used in the work from home methodology, so let this wfh-mate help our mates too....

```No Backend No Server ! Just browser and React ```


# wfh-mate helps you with:

1. Measure your working time.
2. Make your notes.
3. Manage your todo lists for the day.

# wfh-mate components : 
wfh-mate has 3 components where all the functionalities relay , 

## Work timer, calender
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/l2liexgh6tf715f6nmck.png)

this layer has the start button to start the work for the day and end button to end the work at end of the day.
### timer
The timer updates each second and displays how long you've worked for the day. This can help you to finish your after the actual hours of work (8 hrs is official working time here!). After the time you can close your official work and start spending time for your personal things.

### calendar
This is one of the thing i've searched often. Even in the holidays i've logged-in to the office system since I don't know what day it is ! So wfh-mate has a calendar that displays the current date,month and formatted date. You can click that to get the detailed calendar.

## 2.Notes & todo's 
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hppfdcthsjuogwghb84l.png)
We should not test our memory skills in the list of work todo. If you're correct at 9/10 times that one failed can let you in a difficult situation. So mark your list of works to be completed in the particular day using the todo / textarea provided. 

## 3.Water & break timer
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9i2n9n7eaj56w1cur98v.png)
Here comes the most important part or the main line based on which i've created the application. 
*Break timer* - Break is the one which we will less or may be morley use😉 during the WFH. Should avoid taking break ? definitely not!
```Taking a quick break can really help you to fix the things you've been stuck with ``` my most the toughest debugging occurs during the break time , but that must be controlled break as well ! So this timer helps you to take a quick controlled break when the break ends it alerts you by sending a desktop notification or a alert tone or both.

*Water break* - This is the main one we're missing during the WFH even in office too since we're surrounded by air conditioners we get less thirst ! but that can't be a reason . As per U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine , the intake should be 
* About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men
* About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women

so how many of u following this ? myself not ! so this timer can execute every 20/30 minutes and remain you to intake water. Using that break make sure you're drinking the above mentioned level.

```this part reset's during page refresh/reload so kindly restart the timer once if you do refresh/reloaded the page```

## 20-20-20 rule!
Ever heard of this rule ? this is the one we need to follow to avoid *CVS (Computer Vision Syndrome)*  stress caused to eyes by looking at the monitor for a long time.
So here 20-20-20 rule comes to play _every 20 mins take a break for 20 seconds and look at a 20 feet away object_. Whenever the water break alerts , you can follow this rule too! 

# End stats
Once you're done for the day you can press end task and that will give you the exact hours of work you've done after pressing the start work button along with a approx break time taken !
